1. Logger Variable Subscription and their aliases
In Subscribe Logger Variable, all aliases are now selected from the variable table.

When a new logger variable is added, first the alias is checked in the variable table and added to 
the logger table. If the alias does not exist in the var table, the newly typed variable alias is
added to both the var table and the logger table.
